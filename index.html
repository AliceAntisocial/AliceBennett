                    I spent most of my childhood living in Toronto, with my parents
                    and my brother. I've got four siblings, three sisters and one brother
                    but my three sisters grew up with their mom. I loved growing up in 
                    Toronto I lived fairly far from the central core but I still loved 
                    looking out at the skyline at night. I've spent a lot of time 
                    looking out at that skyline, listening to music, or playing music.
                    I play bass and also like to make a bit of music in cakewalk 
                    occasionally.

                    Just this year however I've left Toronto and moved out to Halifax 
                    to pursue a university degree in computer science. It was a 
                    hard decision to make and an emotional departure from Toronto 
                    but I love it here. I'm very lucky to be here, and to be able to 
                    have traded out my Toronto skyline view for the beautiful library 
                    view. A view that I am actually enjoying as this website is being 
                    created.
