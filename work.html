                        one of the first ever jobs I had was working for a small 
                        grocery store called rowe farms. I loved it, it was hard work 
                        though. They had me working every day after school, I'd run 
                        home from my biology class straight to the back of the store 
                        to start on the work I had to get done by the end of the shift. 
                        I worked in the back of the store. that meant that I was in 
                        charge of cleaning all the dishes, dealing with all the waste, 
                        cleaning up for closing, and serving meat from behind the meat 
                        counter. It was a great first job, I loved everyone that I 
                        worked with.

                        the next job I got was with a pharmacy called "Hoopers" it 
                        wasn't as physically intesive as rowe farms was, I wasn't 
                        hauling an oven to the back every shift to clean it, but working
                        at Hoopers was a lot more customer service focused. I worked 
                        at the front operating the cash register, managing and ordering 
                        inventory, and keeping the store clean. I also had to help out 
                        the pharmacists at the back. This mostly entailed filing 
                        prescriptions, answering basic questions about prescriptions, 
                        and answering calls. I also loved this job, and not having as 
                        much physical work after school was very appreciated. The owner 
                        Joe was amazing, so kind, it was really nice to have the owner 
                        be so easy to talk to and understanding. My coworkers were also 
                        great, though mostly a lot older than I was, I always enjoyed the 
                        stories they would tell me when it wasn't too busy.
